# Burger

This simple app logs burgers entered by the user and displays whether the burger is eaten or not. By default, the burger is not eaten. But clicking the button next to a displayed burger will change it from uneaten to eaten (and vice versa). All of the burgers are stored in a MySQL database which the server accesses. This app utilizes Handlebars to handle the HTML, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and my own styling to get the look (which will be improved on at a later date). I also want to set up the list of burgers as a table to make it look a little more organized.
